#	Tamper Detection and Localization in Digital Images Using Fragile Watermarking and Vigen√®re Cipher Encryption Technique: 

Implemented using Spatial domain fragile watermarking. we replace the Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of the host image's pixels with the encrypted watermark data. Authentication involves extracting the watermark from the watermarked image and comparing it with the original watermark.
